                            <p>I am originally from Arizona, where I lived until I came to Dallas to go to college. I
                                enjoy playing
                                basketball, painting, and socializing with friends. My most recent life changes have
                                been marriage and a
                                baby. I have a sweet little girl named Anya whose 6 months old and a handsome husband
                                named Gabe whose older than 6 months. I love to joke around
                                with people, in fact, I've joked around enough to have won class clown in high school
                                and in college
                                (which was a small Catholic college that could have superlatives). I currently work with
                                children as a
                                Child Development Coach with a company called PlayWisely. I get the chance to play with
                                little kids
                                between 4 months to 5 years old. I've always had a knack for being around children,
                                since I grew up with
                                4 younger brithers and 4 older sisters. </p>
                            <p>I got a B.S. in Biology at the University of Dallas, and one of the classes that I took
                                was
                                Bioinformatics. In this class was where I discovered I enjoyed coding, because we got to
                                work with the
                                command line to make folders, and we used Python to analyze sequenced DNA and other
                                different type of
                                biology related data. One of my favorite experiences in college was the research
                                internship I had, where
                                I got to extract my own DNA and sequence it myself. </p>
